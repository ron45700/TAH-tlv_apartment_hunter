# Backlog

**The single place that answers "what is open?"**

`BASELINE.md` records *what the system is*. `DECISIONS.md` records *why*. `SCHEMA.md` records *what
is approved*. `SESSION_LOG.md` records *what happened*. None of them tracks whether a decision
actually reached the code, which is how decisions #37 and #38 were approved on 2026-09-14 and were
still unimplemented on 2026-10-02.

**Last updated:** 2026-10-04

## Rules

1. Every decision that requires a code change gets a row in "Decisions pending implementation" in
   the same session it is recorded in `DECISIONS.md`. The row leaves only when the code and its
   tests are in.
2. A session starts by reading this file and ends by updating it, before `SESSION_LOG.md`.
3. An item is removed when done, not ticked. History belongs to `SESSION_LOG.md`.
4. This file holds no rationale and no schema. It points at the file that does.

## Next sprint (in order)

Phase 1, as detailed in `PHASE_1.md`.

| # | Item | Source | Needs |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | The real runs that close the Phase 1 DoD: A bootstrap, B a normal run started at least 15 minutes after A ends, C killed during the photo download, D the recovery (`DECISIONS.md` #79 D2) | `PHASE_1.md` 1.14 | Ron's separate go, after the code review of task 1.14. Each run sends the $0.50 cap; worst case $1.82 for four runs, hard ceiling $2.00 ($2.50 if C is repeated once). Then `PHASE_1.md` §3, end of phase |

## Decisions pending implementation

| Decision | State of the code (checked 2026-10-04) | What has to change |
|---|---|---|
| #57 the name next to a phone number | Phones are extracted and stored once per post; no name is captured | Gate B defines it (`DECISIONS.md` #57) |
| #77 D4b archiving deletes the image files and removes their `PostImage` entries | Nothing exists; task 1.12 already reads a record archived before #74 without counting its old entries (#77 D4) | Phase 5, the archive job |
| #47 profiles live in the database; no per-user group subscriptions | `config/users/ron.yaml` holds `user_id` and subscribed groups; the config interface exposes them | Remove the per-user YAML and its interface methods when the user records arrive in phase 3. Until then it is unused, not wrong |
| #49 lifecycle and rejection reasons | `PostLifecycle` and its storage exist (task 1.10); the pre-model state and reason (task 1.11) and the repost changes (task 1.3) are stored by `run_once` (task 1.14) | Model-decided reasons in phase 2 |
| #46 archive and deletion | Nothing exists | Stored shape approved at Gate E (#63); the jobs in phase 5 |
| #45 sniper removed | Not in the package. Research copies may sit in `data/raw/` (gitignored) | Nothing in code. Ron may delete the research copies |
| #51, #52 filter model and alert rules | `policy` is a stub | Gate C in phase 3; alerts in phase 4 |
| #56 the bot listens | `notify` is a stub | Phase 4 |
| #61 admin-set run interval and a manual "run now" | No scheduler exists | Phase 5, with the scheduler. Interval and last-run record approved then |
| #62 viewed posts, per user | Nothing exists | Gate C in phase 3 (the per-user record); trigger and "mark as not viewed" in the phase 3 UI design |

---

## Recorded for a later phase

Approved by Ron, 2026-10-04. No code until the phase or gate named.

| Item | When |
|---|---|
| The failure alert to the admin names the reason for a failed run (for example, most rows failed to map — the provider may have changed its response shape, `DECISIONS.md` #71 D) | Phase 5 |
| The digest reports the rows skipped below the #71 D ceiling | Phase 5 |
| On a card whose media came through a repost (`DECISIONS.md` #70, #72.4), the video link comes from the repost, not from the canonical | Phase 3 UI design |
| #70 under dedup B: a repost with rewritten text (`DECISIONS.md` #72.7) | Gate D |
| The lifecycle record has no field saying whether an archived post was classified. A repost of an archived post returns it to the state it had (`DECISIONS.md` #74); in phase 1 one with no rejection reason returns to `pending`. In phase 2 the distinction comes from whether a classification record exists | Gate B |
| Image files with no `PostImage` pointing at them: written by a run that failed after the download and before the store step, for a post that never comes back. A sweep of unreferenced files under `<store_root>/images/` (`DECISIONS.md` #77, plan §3) | Phase 5 |
| On a card, the publication time shown is the earliest `posted_at` of the post and its duplicates: the stored canonical can be later than a duplicate that arrived after it (`DECISIONS.md` #75 A). A display rule | Phase 3 UI design |
| Phase 2 classifies only posts that are `pending` **and** canonical (`is_canonical`); a duplicate's own record can be `pending`, since it is built from its own content (`DECISIONS.md` #75 B) | Gate B |
| The admin lists (rejected, pending, archive) show canonicals only (`DECISIONS.md` #75 B) | Phase 3 |
| Whether a duplicate's retention follows its own clock or its canonical's (`DECISIONS.md` #75 B). Note: `dedup_a` raises when a stored duplicate points at a canonical that is not stored, so deleting a canonical before its duplicates would block the run | Phase 5 |
| The phone as a candidate signal for dedup B; layer 3 of dedup A produces nothing (`DECISIONS.md` #75 C) | Gate D |
| A daily wide run covering 24 h, about $5/month, to heal a per-group miss within a day (`DECISIONS.md` #78 W1) | Phase 5, the scheduler |
| The alert thresholds on `consecutive_failures` (zero-row successful runs). A healthy group can be silent for 31 h, about 49 runs (`DECISIONS.md` #78 W5b, `RESEARCH.md` §9) | Phase 5 |
| Detect a group that fails inside a successful run from the run log, and hold back only that group (`DECISIONS.md` #78 W4). Needs the run-log endpoint verified under the `external-contract-verification` skill, one small test run against an unreachable group (about $0.01; Ron approves it when planned), and `fetch()` returning per-group status (a provider contract change). Rests on P13, ASSUMED | Its own task, when Ron schedules it |
| Groups × `max_posts` must stay below the charge cap's `maxItems` (333 at $0.50); a seventh group at 50 crosses it (`DECISIONS.md` #78 W3) | Planning group editing (phase 6) |
| Adding a group needs a way to create its `GroupWatermark` without a full bootstrap; outside bootstrap a configured group with no record raises (`DECISIONS.md` #78 W7) | Planning group editing (phase 6) |
| `DECISIONS.md` #11 says the first run "sends one summary"; `BASELINE.md` §4 says a bootstrap run alerts nothing. Not resolved | Ron decides when phase 4 is planned |

---

## Known limits, not handled now

| Limit | Effect |
|---|---|
| A group that fails inside a successful run advances like the others; its window is lost (`DECISIONS.md` #78 W4) | Posts missed for good, until the run-log task above exists |
| A group at `max_posts` short of its window still advances; `advance` reports it (`DECISIONS.md` #78 W3) | The posts between its window start and its oldest returned post may be missed for good. A row skipped under #71 D lowers the count, and such a group can go unreported |
| A run killed during `fetch()` (Ctrl+C, `taskkill`) does not abort its Apify run: only the run deadline aborts (`DECISIONS.md` #71 F, #79) | The Apify run finishes and is billed, up to the $0.50 cap; its dataset is never read. The watermark does not move |
| `dedup_a` finds a canonical's stored duplicates through the hashes of the canonical and of its batch duplicates (`DECISIONS.md` #75 D1). A stored duplicate with media whose text was edited later has a different hash and is not found | #70 can miss it, and a canonical with no media can return to `"rejected"` |

---

## Open technical choices

Left open on purpose until their phase is planned (`DECISIONS.md` #23).

| Choice | Decide when |
|---|---|
| Dashboard framework and how the site is served | Planning phase 3 |
| Telegram library | Planning phase 4 |
| How the scheduler runs inside the container. It must be interval-based (the interval is an admin setting) and support a manual run that resets the timer on success (`DECISIONS.md` #61). One run at a time: a run can last longer than the 30-minute interval, since the image download alone may take up to 30 minutes (#77 D5b). `run_once` takes no lock; a run overtaken by a later one fails at `advance` and moves no watermark (`DECISIONS.md` #79 O9) | Planning phase 5 |
| Public source for Tel Aviv areas and streets (`ASSUMPTIONS.md` A1) | Before Gate B |
| SQLite journal mode: the default rollback journal now; WAL is the candidate once the dashboard reads while a run writes (`DECISIONS.md` #65) | Planning phase 3 |
| A shared post with its own caption: its `text` is the caption, and `sharedPost.text` (the shared listing) never reaches the model. Gate A unchanged (`DECISIONS.md` #71, H; `ASSUMPTIONS.md` P16) | Gate B (phase 2) |
| Concurrent writes to `PostLifecycle`. `save_lifecycle` is a whole-record replace, last write wins: a user flagging a post while a run writes the same record loses one of the two changes. Phase 1 has one writer. A contract test pins the current behaviour (`DECISIONS.md` #65) | Planning phase 3 |

---

## Doc debt

| Item | Where |
|---|---|
| Not recorded outside `SESSION_LOG.md`: documented top-level `user_id` absent from the real response; `RawPost` validators; `FixtureProvider` inclusive `since` | `ASSUMPTIONS.md` / `SCHEMA.md` |

---

## Future (recorded, not planned)

| Item | Note |
|---|---|
| memo23 failover | `BASELINE.md` §12, phase 6 |
| Editing the schedule and the group list from the dashboard | `BASELINE.md` §12, phase 6 |
| `max_posts` editable by the admin | `BASELINE.md` §11, §12 phase 6. Approved by Ron, 2026-10-04; recorded, not built. One value for all groups (the actor takes one `maxPosts` per run). On save, the system refuses a value where groups × `max_posts` reaches the charge cap's `maxItems`. Open, decided when planned: whether the charge cap itself is editable |
| UI polish from Ron's screenshots | `BASELINE.md` §12, phase 6 |
| Yad2 as an additional source | `DECISIONS.md` #60. Open points from the old plan: `RawPost` is Facebook-shaped (`group_id` required, `source` accepts two values); whether structured Yad2 listings pass through the model; dedup across sources; terms of use |
| Comments scraping | Not planned |
| Parallel image downloads, if runs prove too long | Not planned; recorded 2026-10-04 with Ron's approval. Ron chose the 30-minute budget instead (`DECISIONS.md` #77 D5b). Would need its own check for throttling (`ASSUMPTIONS.md` I11 covers sequential requests only), and must keep #77 D3's order inside each group |
